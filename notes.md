#How I used Variables & data types ,Control structures ,Loops Functions ,Events and DOM manipulation
Variables like bookings, flaggedDuplicates, and pods to store and track data. Uses data types such as strings ("POD-A"), numbers (capacity: 4), arrays (["SIT-001"]), and objects ({ podId, time, students }). 
Control structures such as if statements checked conditions like booking limits and time validity. 
Loops (for, for...of) in functions like renderBookings() and updateInsights() to iterate through bookings and calculate statistics.
Functions like renderBookings() and updateInsights()to organize tasks. 
Events like form submission and table button clicks are captured using addEventListener() to respond to user actions.  
DOM manipulation through document.getElementById() and createElement() to dynamically update page elements like tables, dropdowns, and error messages in real time.
